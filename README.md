my stupid kernel i made for funsie in c, thanks to [micl](https://micl.dev/) for giving me a great base with the asm and help with the itoa fuction. also the [osdev wiki ](https://wiki.osdev.org) has been of great help. Also warning: you cant use more than 4gb of ram due to it being 32 bit, but i plan to make it 64 bit one day.
## dependancys:
- nasm, ld. c compiler, qemu
## usage:
runninbg make run should work
```make run```
or to just build it run
```make```
## issues (i noticed so far):
