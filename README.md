# spos
my stupid kernel i made for funsie in zig, thanks to [micl](https://micl.dev/) for giving me a great base (the asm)
## dependancys:
- nasm, ld. zig 1.14, qemu
## usage:
runninbg make run should work
```make run```
or to just build it run
```make```
## issues (i noticed so far):
- echo sometimes glitches
- you can delete basicly everything on screen
